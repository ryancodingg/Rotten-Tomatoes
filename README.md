# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the Rotten Tomatoes rating of movies based on critic reviews. By utilizing two large datasets, namely rotten_tomatoes_critic_reviews.csv and rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv obtained from Kaggle, I aim to develop a classification algorithm that can effectively predict the rating of movies.

Rotten Tomatoes is a popular online platform that provides movie reviews and ratings. The ratings provided on Rotten Tomatoes are determined by a combination of critics' reviews and audience ratings. Critics' reviews play a significant role in influencing the overall rating assigned to a movie. Therefore, by analyzing critic reviews, we can gain insights into the sentiment and opinions expressed by critics, which can subsequently be used to predict the movie's Rotten Tomatoes rating.
